# read-multiple-gamepads
In Unity 2019.1 how can I read all the inputs from a gamepad controller (like a Xbox 360 controller or Playstation Controller)? After that how can I read the input from multiple gamepad controllers so I can make a two player game? In this Omarvision tutorial video I show you how to read from multiple gamepad controllers at once. It's easy. You can download my InputManager.asset file or make one yourself in the project settings.
